\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}



\textbf{Budget:} \pounds 500 000

\textbf{Time:} 2 months
\\
\\
\textbf{Crucial constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
\item   Time constraint 
\item  Performing proper tests. Consider all cases and potential errors places or exceptional situations is unlikely
\item Limited budget
\item Sustaining highest possible performance having reliable system is difficult to implement and to maintain
\item Demand of high C++ knowledge in developer team, it could be hard to get specialist and introduce him to project with constrained time 
\item For enormous jobs there could be lack of operating memory
\item Limited storage gives constraint of less regular backup making
\item Physical machine have to be stored in appropriate conditions, in room with air-conditioning
\end{itemize}
 


\section{User Documentation}

Additionally to this SRS document there are also following sources about supercomputer system:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Code documentation
\item  Document of test plan of software
\end{itemize}


\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the 
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial 
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating 
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions 
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the 
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to 
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for 
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
$<$Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software 
product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards 
or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout 
constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on 
every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on.  
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of 
the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface 
specification.$>$

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
$<$Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between 
the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include 
the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions 
between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be 
used.$>$

\section{Software Interfaces}
$<$Describe the connections between this product and other specific software 
components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, 
libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or 
messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each.  
Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to 
documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols.  
Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data 
sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a 
global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an 
implementation constraint.$>$

\section{Communications Interfaces}
$<$Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions 
required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server 
communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent 
message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such 
as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data 
transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.$>$


\chapter{System Features}
$<$This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the 
product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may 
prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, 
object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the 
most logical sense for your product.$>$

\section{System Feature 1}
$<$Don’t really say “System Feature 1.” State the feature name in just a few 
words.$>$

\subsection{Description and Priority}
$<$Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of 
High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority 
component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a 
relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).$>$

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
$<$List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the 
behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements 
associated with use cases.$>$

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
$<$Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature.  
These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user 
to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case.  
Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or 
invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, 
verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary 
information is not yet available.$>$

$<$Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a 
meaningful tag of some kind.$>$

circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the 
developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the 
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific 
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual 
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety Requirements}
$<$Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or 
harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or 
actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to 
any external policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the 
product’s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be 
satisfied.$>$

\section{Security Requirements}

important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: 
adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, 
maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, 
and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when 
possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, 
such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\section{Business Rules}
$<$List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or 
roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not 
functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional 
requirements to enforce the rules.$>$


\chapter{Other Requirements}
$<$Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might 
include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal 
requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections 
that are pertinent to the project.$>$

\section{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
$<$Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including 
acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans 
multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to 
a single project in each SRS.$>$

\section{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow 
diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship 
diagrams.$>$
