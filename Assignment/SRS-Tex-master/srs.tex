\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
Creating a supercomputer simulation software and tests. Computer has to calculate demanded jobs ordered by users of three groups: IT support, Researches and Students. Computer must be efficient and must work stably, reliably and without errors. System will be tested to make sure that computer will provide highest possible quality of results and precisions of calculations.




\section{Document Conventions}


Most crucial words are bold like \textbf{Total budget}, \textbf{number of nodes} or \textbf{number of cores}. Both Functional requirements and Non-functional requirements are presented in tables which contains: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Description
	\item Rationale
	\item Originator 
	\item Fit Criterion
\end{itemize}  


    

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}





Document is created to be easy to read. Document contains many tables in order to provide transparency and high clarity. This Software Requirements Specification document (SRS) is especially designed for potential customers, at the same time providing numbers of useful information destined for potential users as IT support, Students and Researches.

\section{Operating Environment}



System was developed for following working environment:
\\
\\
Software:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Windows systems( versions 7/8/10)
\item  Linux Ubuntu Server, Debian
\end{itemize}
 
Hardware:
\begin{itemize}
\item   Athos - iDataPlex DX360M4, Intel Xeon E5-2697v2 12C 2.700GHz, Infiniband FDR14
IBM 	
\item  138 Nodes (including two accelerated nodes and  six specialized nodes,  using for rendering and visualization of complex data)
\item 50 PB of storage
\item 128 GB DDR4 Ram per node
\end{itemize}

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}



\textbf{Budget:} \pounds 500 000

\textbf{Time:} 2 months
\\
\\
\textbf{Crucial constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
\item   Time constraint 
\item  Performing proper tests. Consider all cases and potential errors places or exceptional situations is unlikely
\item Limited budget
\item Sustaining highest possible performance having reliable system is difficult to implement and to maintain
\item Demand of high C++ knowledge in developer team, it could be hard to get specialist and introduce him to project with constrained time 
\item For enormous jobs there could be lack of operating memory
\item Limited storage gives constraint of less regular backup making
\item Physical machine have to be stored in appropriate conditions, in room with air-conditioning
\end{itemize}

components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, 
libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or 
messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each.  
Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to 
documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols.  
Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data 
sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a 
global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an 
implementation constraint.$>$

\section{Communications Interfaces}
$<$Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions 
required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server 
communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent 
message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such 
as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data 
transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.$>$

\section{Performance Requirements}
$<$If there are performance requirements for the product under various 
circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the 
developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the 
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific 
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual 
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety Requirements}
$<$Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or 
harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or 
actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to 
any external policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the 
product’s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be 
satisfied.$>$

\section{Security Requirements}
$<$Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use 
of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define 
any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or 
regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any 
security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.$>$

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
$<$Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be 
important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: 
adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, 
maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, 
and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when 
possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, 
such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\section{Business Rules}
$<$List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or 
roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not 
functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional 
requirements to enforce the rules.$>$


\chapter{Other Requirements}
$<$Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might 
include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal 
requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections 
that are pertinent to the project.$>$

\section{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
$<$Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including 
acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans 
multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to 
a single project in each SRS.$>$

\section{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow 
diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship 
diagrams.$>$

\section{Appendix C: To Be Determined List}
$<$Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain
